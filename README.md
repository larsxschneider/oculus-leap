# Oculus-Leap

This little experiment uses the Oculus Room Demo and integrates it with a Leap Motion to get an idea how positional tracking would feel like.
My impression is that the sense of depth is much better.

## Setup
Copy the "LibOVR" directory from the OculusSDK into the 3rdParty directory.
Copy the entire "LeapSDK" directory into the 3rdParty directory.
